-:One-sample T-test:-

given:
x=(34,35,45,34,56,23,34)
Test Value = 40


Null hypothesis: H0:µ=40
Alternative Hypothesis: H1:µ≠40


#Applying T-test


#One sample t-test
> t.test(x,mu=40)


> t.test(x,mu=40,alternative = c("two.sided"),conf.level=0.95)
> t.test(x,mu=40,alternative = c("greater"),conf.level=0.95)

#Observation
1. One-sample t-test is performed to determine if the mean of a sample (denoted as "x") is significantly different from a hypothesized value of 40.
2. The test statistic (t) is calculated as -0.6892. The degrees of freedom (df) for the t-distribution is 6. The p-value associated with the test is 0.5164.
3. The alternative hypothesis is stated as "the true mean is not equal to 40." This means mean of the sample differs significantly from 40, either being greater or smaller.
4. The 95 percent confidence interval is computed as (27.64904, 46.92239). This interval represents a range within which we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies.
5. The sample estimate is the mean of the sample, which is calculated as 37.28571.

Based on the given results, since the p-value (0.5164) is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore, we cannot conclude that the true mean is significantly different from 40 based on the given sample.
